#### RANK() and DENSE_RANK()
> RANK() would give the identical rows a rank of 2, then skip ranks 3 and 4, so the next result would be 5
> DENSE_RANK() would still give all the identical rows a rank of 2, but the following row would be 3â€”no ranks would be skipped.
select dealer_id, sales, emp_name, rank() over (partition by dealer_id order by sales) as 'row'
from ql_sales;



#### Running Total
> partition by with a sub-clause order by in sum/avg, it will get the running total/average
